# Quiz 3
***
1. The three steps of making a scientific inference are obtaining observational data (recording what we observe from senses and data), constructing a model then calibrate and validate it, then making inferences or predictions.
2. The three pillars of science are Experiment/Observations, Theory/Physical Models, and Computational/Data-Driven Models.
3. The three major applications of the third pillar of science are artificial intelligence, machine learning, and predictive computing.
4. The two types of scientific reasoning are Deductive and Plausible Reasoning.  
a. Deductive Reasoning example argument: All dogs have four legs and I have a pet dog; therefore, my dog has four legs.  
b. Plausible Reasoning example argument: There was a lot of rain yesterday and the street is wet; therefore, it's possible that it is still raining.
5. Logical implication is not the same as physical causation.  Example: A person owns a car, therefore they have a driver's license.
6. Boolean algebra was named after George Boole (1854).

9. If two Boolean propositions are equal, it means those two propositions have the same value(s) and are logically equivalent.

18.  Overall, I think the quiz was a bit unfair as there are numerous Venn diagrams or visual representations (e.g. truth tables) that we have to construct, which takes up a considerable time.  Furthermore, the topics that this quiz goes over is a bit confusing for some and hard to pick up.
