3. Local, distributed, and centralized.
4. Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) is the best because it is the most recently developed VCS and addresses the limitations of local and centralized VCS by allowing each client to have a copy of the central database on their local device.
5. 
   a. git pull: this prompts the git-bash to pull the latest project revision from the remote to the local repository 
   b. git status: this command prompts to check the status of the project 
   c. git add --all: stages all changes in the working directory for the next commit
   d. git commit -m"latest build": commits the staged files to the local repository with the message "latest build" 
   e. git push --all: pushes all the commits from the local repository to the remote repository
