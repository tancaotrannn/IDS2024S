1.  The three pillars of science are Experiemnt/Observations, Theory/Physical Models, and Computational/Data-Driven Models.
2.  The three different applications of Computer and Data Sciences are Predictive computing, Numerical simulation, and Data-driven discovery (e.g. machine learning, deep learning).
3.  The two types of scientific reasoning are Deductive and Plausible Reasoning.  
  a.  Deductive Reasoning example argument: All dogs have four legs and I have a pet dog; therefore, my dog has four legs.  
  b.  Plausible Reasoning example argument: There was a lot of rain yesterday and the street is wet; therefore, it's possible that it is still raining.  
4.  An example would be: It is raining, therefore the sky is cloudly.  
5.  The reasoning process goes like this:  if a burglar alarm sounds and a man crawls out of the broken window of the jewelry store with anything suspicious (in this case the bag of jewelry), then that man is the perpetrator of the crime.

12.  Answers for sub questions:  
a. **Bit** is the tiniest unit of information  
b. This amount of information represents the tiniest information unit because it only stores a binary value of either 0 or 1, which is a small amount of data and is easy and quick to store.  
c.  I won't be able to tell my coordinates in the universe.  The only way I can tell I'm moving is because I am on Earth which is moving at its own orbiting speed around the sun in the Solar System.  This is thanks to the observations and information that scientists and astronauts gathered for us.  
i.  2 possibilities  
ii. 3 possibilities  
iii. 12 possibilities
